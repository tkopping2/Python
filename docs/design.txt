Problem Statement:
If you remember from my Programming Fundamentals class, I am an enormous history enthusiast, specifically medieval Western European history. I spend a lot of free time reading and watching documentaries on this topic. I also enjoy running battle simulations and testing different medieval military tactics and strategies. I run these simulations quite often, and up until now, I have been recording my simulations in a simple notebook with a pen. Not only am I running out of notebook room, but I need a more efficient and organized way to record my data. I need it to store these field names: battleNames, date, countriesInvolved, winner, loser, victorForces, vanquishedForces, totalVictorDeaths, totalVanquishedDeaths, significantFiguresPresent, and notableDeaths. Also, when the user selects to display all battles, I need this software to calculate total deaths and add a Total Deaths column after the totalVanquishedDeaths. This program should connect to an SQLite Database.

Welcome to my program!
I completed this code in steps similar to how we’ve done it week to week. Before I had it connected to the SQLite Database, it was writing everything into a CSV. I did this because, as stated in the problem statement, I will actually be using this program regularly, and I prefer to store my data in a CSV for Excel. I am saying this because I connected it to a CSV before, so there might be some things I missed or forgot to take out when I changed from importing CSV to importing SQLite3. I tried to use this hasattr() function (has attribute) instead of a try-except block, just because while I was coding another program on my own, I learned that it is more conventional, but I was struggling with it a bit. I tried to use it to shorten some code and get rid of some try-except blocks, but I kept running into syntax errors. I did get it to work in my update_Battle()  and delete_Battle() functions because they both need to check if a battle object has an ID in the database. I also used a simple setattr() function (set attribute) in my edit_Battle() function. This function is pretty straightforward and makes it much easier to edit the attributes of the battles I have stored. Believe it or not, some of the hardest parts in this code were the formatting. I wanted to center the welcome page, main menu, and the menu options. Little did I know how difficult that was. A lot of adjusting, saving, and running the module to try and get the formatting right. Throughout my code, you’ll see variables like padding, VISUAL_SHIFT, and TARGET_WIDTH. These are variables used in my centering functions and when formatting. In my display_All_Battles() function, you’ll see that for each battle, I have two sections. The top one is for the shorter values, and the bottom section has the longer values detailing the battles. This way looks the best visually because it allows the user to see my significantFiguresPresent and notableDeaths fields. For menu options 5 and 6, I used the sorted() function to sort my battles by date from oldest to most recent and from most recent to oldest. I used the lambda function to tell the sorted() function what to sort by. Since the sorted() function sorts in ASC order by default, I didn’t need any more arguments for my sort_Battles() function. However, for my sort_Battles_Desc() function, after the lambda function is used, I added a reverse=True argument. Since it sorts in ASC order by default, I had to reverse it to get it in DESC order. I also used the next() function in my look_Up_Battle() function to search through my battles list and find the battleName attribute that matches the user's input string. This was incredibly useful because I didn’t want to look up battles by index, because if there are 50 battles stored, how would I know which battle is where? I thought this was a more efficient way to search for battles. Plus, I’ve been waiting for an excuse to use this next() function. It’s been interesting learning the built-in Python functions because they come in handy and definitely improve code readability. Overall, I enjoyed this project, and I’m happy that I got to create something that I’ll be using.
